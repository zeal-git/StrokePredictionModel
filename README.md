# StrokePredictionModel
This project aims to predict the probability of stroke in individuals using various health features provided in the dataset. The prediction model is based on data collected from Kaggle. The dataset contains factors such as age, gender, marital status, smoking status, hypertension, heart disease, and more. A machine learning model(such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or GridSearchCV) is trained to predict the probability of stroke. 

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:

1) PYTHON: The project is implemented using python.

2) numpy: for numerical computation
   pandas: for data manipulation
   matplotlib and seaborn: for data visualization
   scikit-learn: for building, training model 

3) jupyter lab: for development and analysis
